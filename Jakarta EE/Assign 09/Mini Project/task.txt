create an entity "Student" with
	int rollno   [ id ]
	String name
	String address

create an interface StudentDAO with method
	void addStudent(Student)

create two implementations

	StudentDAOFileImpl.java
		which will persist given student inside file using serialization.

	StudentDAODataImpl.java
		which will persist given student inside database using hibernate.

Add.jsp

	Enter student name:
	Enter student address:

	Select persistence store: dropdown with values
		file 
		database

	submit

on submit control should go to "AddServlet"

AddServlet will have a reference to StudentDAO sdao; the idea here is that "sdao" can point to any implementation of "StudentDAO" and invoke "addStudent()" polymorphically.

inside doPost() method 
a) instantiate "Student" with the values provided by user.
b) u will check the persistence store selected by user.

if this is "file"
	set the rollno.
	servlet will instantiate "StudentDAOFileImpl" and invoke "addStudent()" method.

if this is "data"
	servlet will instantiate "StudentDAODataImpl" and invoke "addStudent()" method.
