generate an entity class "Dept" inside "mypack" using reverse engg technique.

Data.jsp -> DataServlet 

	in jsp u need to have
		Search By loc:-  <textfield>
		<submit>

user will enter "location" and click on submit. Request will go to DataServlet , which will search records from database where location is  the one entered by user (using HQL). This will give a servlet List which will contain "Dept" objects for matching condition.

servlet will store this List inside "request" attribute and forward it to the same jsp i.e. "Data.jsp" from where u have come inside servlet.

Data.jsp will display the arraylist using EL and JSTL.
