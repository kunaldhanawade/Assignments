 public class Book 
{
	private int id;
	private String title;
	private int cost;
	private Set<Author> authors;

	// getters and setters

}

public class Author
{
	private int id;
	private String name;
	private String address;

	// getters and setters

}


Book has Authors [ one to many ]

create one instance of Book and add atleast 3 authors inside it.
now persist and retrieve Group only [ it should not retrieve authors -  poof - you should be able to see sql query for Book and not for Authors ]
